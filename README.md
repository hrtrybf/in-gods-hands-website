Prompt:
You are a developer building a modern, single‑page website for “In God’s Hands Lawn & Tree Service” using the content provided below. The site must convey quality, integrity, and dependability with a clean, responsive design.
Content & Requirements:
Header: Include the company logo (the attached logo photo) as the design’s base, along with the tagline “Quality. Integrity. Dependability.”
About Us: Present a concise paragraph explaining that the company is locally owned, professional, and dedicated to high‑quality lawn care, landscaping, and tree services.
Our Services: List the services (lawn mowing/maintenance, tree trimming/removal, bush trimming, mulching, weeding/flower bed maintenance, gravel installation, gutter cleaning, seasonal aeration) with starting prices.
Why Choose Us: Use bullet points for key values (experience, affordability, customer satisfaction, full insurance).
Testimonials: Display at least two testimonials (from “Dottie A.” and “Joseph T.”).
Get in Touch: Provide the contact details (phone: (330) 510‑0382, placeholder email, and social media links) plus a note that the service areas include Stow, Hudson, Kent, Macedonia, Boston Heights, and—extended for future integration—the areas of Hudson, Silver Lake, Stow, Aurora, Ravenna, Chagrin Falls, and West Akron, Ohio.
Future Integration Placeholder: Include a “Book Now” or “Contact” button that will later link to a Yardbook account and a messaging system.
Design & Build Requirements:
Use best practices for accessibility and responsive design.
Keep the code simple (HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript) so that future backend functionality (like Yardbook integration) can be added easily.
Automate as much as possible using GitHub Pro features—GitHub Pages for free hosting and GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.
Create a corresponding Google Docs file for his email communication that outlines the site details and instructions.
Objective:
Build, test, and deploy the front‑end website within 3–6 hours so that a live URL can be delivered today.
Remember this prompt as your guiding specification for both design and development.
